The Odin Project - Google Homepage

Just finished this first project for TOP. Though it seemed relatively simple at the outset to make a mockup of the Google page (it looks like such a minimalist design), it ended up taking quite a bit of work to get it close enough, visually, for me to be happy with it. And despite completing all of the freecodecamp.org tuturoials for HTML as instructed, it was difficult to translate the lessons into actual coding (perhaps I did not retain enough of the concepts/knowledge). I don't feel confident in the code I wrote for this project, but I do think it was useful to go through the process of trial and error, over and over, to identify gaps in my understanding and work to close them. I'm sure there will be much more of that as I progress through the coursework.
